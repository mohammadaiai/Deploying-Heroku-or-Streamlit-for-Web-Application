# Deploying Heroku or Streamlit for Creating Web Applications
This repository provides the instructions on how to deploy your Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) applications on the Heroku or Streamlit servers. 
## Heroku
To use Heroku for creating ML/DL web applications, you need these files:
1. **app.py** --> Your application file 
2. **Reqirements.txt** --> The libraries used in your application
3. **Procfile**
4. **setup.sh**

Note that the files are case-sensitive and have to be as presented above. The example files are available in the **Heroku folder** in this repo.

## Streamlit
To use Streamlit for deploying your application, you just need to create an account in the Streamlit website and connect it to your GitHub repo and select the app.py file for deployment. Note that the program has to be programmed in the Streamlit Python library, which is desinged for creating ML/DL applications.
