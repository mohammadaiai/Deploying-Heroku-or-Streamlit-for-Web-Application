# Deploying Heroku or Streamlit for Creating Web Applications
This repository provides the instructions on how to deploy your Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) applications on the Heroku or Streamlit servers. 
## Heroku
To use Heroku for creating ML/DL web applications, you need your app file (app.py) and some necessary components (Procfile, setup.sh, and requirements.txt), which are all available in the **Heroku folder** in this repo (Note that the file names have to be the same as provided in the folder--Do not change the cases). The requirements file must include the used libraries in your application file (app.py), but the Procfile and setup.sh should remain as they are in the folder. Then, create an account in Heroku website and connect your account to the Github repo and deploy the app. 

## Streamlit
To use Streamlit for deploying your application, you just need to create an account in the Streamlit website and connect it to your GitHub repo and select the app.py file for deployment. Note that the program has to be programmed in the Streamlit Python library, which is desinged for creating ML/DL applications.
